<h3>🚂 The Parkland Walk</h3>
<ul>
<li>📍 The Parkland Walk runs from Finsbury Park to Alexandra Palace.</li>
<li>☝️ Fun Fact: The park is former railway line and includes features such as arches, old platforms and tunnels. Part of the old tunnels are now a bat reserve.</li>
<li>👍 Top Tip: You can stop for a coffee and a snack at cafe Merro which was formerly the site of Crouch End Station.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🚡 The Line</h3>
<ul>
<li>📍 This walk takes you along canals and rivers all the way from Stratford to Greenwich.</li>
<li>☝️ Fun Fact: The Line is a sculpture trail walk and recommends crossing the Thames via the cable car which is fun with great views if you haven't had the reason to check it out before.</li>
<li>👍 Top Tip: A wonderful pit stop along the route is Cody Dock where you can stop for a drink and snack at the Riverside Cafe.</li>
</ul>

<h3> 🦢 Victoria Park to Walthamstow Wetlands</h3>
<ul>
<li>📍 A classic loop around Victoria Park extended up to Hackney and Walthamstow Marshes and along the River Lea into the Wetlands.</li> 
<li>☝️ Fun Fact: As well as being one of the largest urban wetland nature reserves in Europe, the reservoirs in the wetlands supply drinking water to 3.5 million people every day!</li>
<li>👍 Top Tip: Treat yourself to a refreshing drink in the tranquil garden of the Ferry Boat Inn before heading back!</li>

<h3>🏞️ Canal Walk: Victoria Park to Regent's Park</h3>
<ul>
<li>📍 Takes you from east to west London along the Regent's canal via Islington, King's Cross and Camden.</li>
<li>☝️ Fun Fact: Although the canal was only built in the early 19th Century, by the late 1800s, there plans and attempts to turn the canal into a railway! Luckily none of them were successful and we still have this relaxing waterway in our City.</li>
<li>👍 Top Tip: An urban walk with plenty of opportunities to stop for coffees, pints and food. I recommend being patient and waiting for Purezza vegan pizza in Camden!</li>
</ul>
