# My Hobby Page

## About

I made a hobby page about my favourite walks in London. I thought it might encourage people to explore some of these places or revisit them if they have not been in a while.

## Structure

I structured my page with headings and lists. Keeping the same format for each list for consistency.

## Challenges and Learnings

I found the most challenging part getting the date to display. I asked for help at the meetup and the mentors and a really helpful applicant gave me lots of advice and tips :)
